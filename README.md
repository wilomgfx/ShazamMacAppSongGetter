# ShazamMacAppSongGetter
As amazing as the shazam mac app is to find songs around you,it does not connect with your shazam account and does not suggest other providers but apple music! This tool solves the problem :D!

# Why you may ask ?
- Im lazy and i dont want to copy & paste in my music player all the songs i found...
- It get can get really messy the more songs it finds !
